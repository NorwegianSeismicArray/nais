### NORSAR Artificial Inteligence Toolkit (NAIT)
This repository will eventually contain tools specific to aiding in AI research at NORSAR.

This repository will contain: 
* Baseline models, for waveforms and spectrograms. Possibly pretrained for certain tasks.
* Standard datasets to test models. Development of new models can be difficult. Standard datasets eliminates errors in the data and lets you focus on developing the model. 
  * Classification
  * Regression
  * Masking (eg. arrival picking)
* Augmentation methods.
